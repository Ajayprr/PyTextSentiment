Cloath collections are not good .
I can not love her
I don't trust her .
The inability to perform good under high temperature rendered the machine unusable.
The inability of chef to cook delicious food forced customers move away from restaurant .
The band is incapable of producing good music .
They serve least tasty grill in town  .
I am the only person who is least angry with her today . 
They never cooked good food .
They were never happy
They never looked happy
they never looked truly happy
It did no good to anyone.
I have no love towards non religious people
no one got angry on her
no one is afraid of islamic terrorist 
nobody likes display of iphone .
nobody is happy in this country
nobody likes her
non of them looked happy.
none of them looked happy.
none of them are happy.
The food is not bad
he did not look disappointed
She do not love me
They did not disappoint me 
She is not going to feel happy
She is not among those who are happy about the policy
nothing is good in this store .
nothing was interesting in the carnival
nothing can make her happy
nothing is surprising
occasionally they cooked good food .
occasionally she gets frustrated
unable  to deliver good quality of code .
unable to surprise her.
I was unable to make her happy
they would not please her
She is barely happy
She barely trusts him
She barely enjoyed the show
They barely lived happily
It is less painful
Maybe she is sad
she is only angry
She is only upset
Demise of his dog failed to make him sad
The suspense thriller failed to surprise audience
She is just upset
She is just angry
I can bet that she is anything but happy
She looked angry but she enjoyed the meal
She looked happy but she was full of apprehension 
I am neither happy nor sad .
I am neither angry nor afraid 
I am neither happy nor sad .
